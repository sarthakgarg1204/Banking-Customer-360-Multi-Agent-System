# Multi-Agent Solution for Customer 360 Data Product in Retail Banking

I'll design a comprehensive multi-agent solution that can automate the creation of a Customer 360 data product for retail banking. This solution will streamline the entire process from understanding business requirements to certifying the final data product.

## 1. Understanding the Business Use Case

### Use Case Agent Design
The Use Case Agent will interpret business requirements through:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Ability to parse business documentation, meeting notes, and interview transcripts
- **Domain-Specific Knowledge Base**: Pre-trained on retail banking terminology and common business objectives
- **Requirement Classification**: Categorizing requirements into functional areas (marketing, risk, service personalization)

### Implementation Approach
The agent would:
1. Ingest requirement documents through text extraction APIs
2. Identify key objectives using named entity recognition and semantic analysis
3. Generate a structured requirements document with categorized business needs
4. Validate understanding by generating clarifying questions for domain experts

For a personalized banking service use case, the agent would identify:
- Primary objective: Improve customer insights for targeted services
- Key performance indicators: Customer retention rate, cross-sell success, risk assessment accuracy
- Stakeholder requirements: Marketing needs vs. risk management needs vs. customer service needs

## 2. Recommending Target Data Product Structure

### Data Designer Agent Capabilities
This agent will:
- Analyze the structured requirements from the Use Case Agent
- Apply industry best practices for banking data modeling
- Generate appropriate schema recommendations

### Proposed Customer 360 Structure
For retail banking, the recommended structure would include:

**Core Customer Entity**:
- Unique customer identifier
- Demographics (name, age, address, contact information)
- Customer segment classification
- Customer lifetime value
- Risk profile score

**Related Entities**:
- Account information (types, balances, status)
- Transaction history (by category, frequency, amount)
- Product ownership and usage patterns
- Service interaction history
- Financial goals and preferences
- External credit information

**Data Model Recommendation**:
A hybrid approach using:
- Relational tables for structured data (core demographics, accounts)
- Document store for semi-structured data (interaction history)
- Graph relationships for network connections (household relationships, referrals)

## 3. Identifying Source Systems and Attributes

### Source System Agent Design
This agent will:
- Interface with enterprise data catalogs and metadata repositories
- Crawl database schemas and API documentation
- Apply data lineage tracking

### Source System Identification Process
1. Query data governance catalogs for system inventory
2. Analyze system documentation for relevant data entities
3. Examine data dictionary and metadata repositories
4. Evaluate data quality metrics for candidate sources

### Typical Retail Banking Source Systems
The agent would identify these common systems:
- Core Banking System (account details, balances)
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system
- Transaction Processing System
- Digital Banking Platforms (online/mobile banking interaction data)
- Call Center/Support Systems
- Marketing Campaign Management Systems
- External Credit Bureau APIs
- Loan Origination Systems
- Know Your Customer (KYC)/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems

### Attribute Identification
For each source system, the agent would extract:
- Available attributes and their definitions
- Data types and formats
- Update frequency
- Privacy/sensitivity classifications
- Data quality metrics

## 4. Mapping Generation

### Mapping Agent Capabilities
The Mapping Agent will:
- Create source-to-target attribute mappings
- Define transformation logic where needed
- Generate implementation code for ETL processes
- Document mapping decisions and rationales

### Mapping File Structure
The agent would produce mapping specifications with:

```
Source System: Core Banking System
Source Table: CUSTOMER
Source Attribute: CUST_DOB
Target Entity: CustomerProfile
Target Attribute: dateOfBirth
Mapping Type: Transformation
Transformation Logic: CONVERT(DATE, CUST_DOB, 112)
Data Type: DATE
Privacy Classification: PII
Description: Customer date of birth standardized to ISO format
Quality Checks: Not null, valid date range (age 18-120)
```

### Transformation Types
The agent would support various transformations:
- Direct mapping (1:1 copy)
- Format standardization
- Aggregation
- Derivation (calculated fields)
- Conditional logic
- Lookup mappings (code to description)

## 5. Certification of the Data Product

### Certification Agent Capabilities
This agent will:
- Validate data product against governance standards
- Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements
- Verify data quality
- Document access controls and security measures

### Certification Process
1. **Data Quality Validation**:
   - Completeness check (required fields populated)
   - Consistency verification (cross-field validation)
   - Accuracy testing (sample validation against source)
   - Timeliness assessment (recency of data)

2. **Governance Compliance**:
   - Privacy classification verification
   - Sensitive data handling validation
   - Retention policy enforcement
   - Usage restriction documentation

3. **Accessibility Setup**:
   - Metadata enrichment for searchability
   - Access control configuration
   - API endpoint creation
   - Documentation generation

4. **Operational Readiness**:
   - Ingress process verification
   - Egress method testing
   - SLA monitoring setup
   - Alerting mechanism configuration

## 6. Agentic Flow Design

### Agent Collaboration Framework
The multi-agent system will operate as follows:

1. **Orchestrator Agent**:
   - Controls overall workflow
   - Manages communication between specialized agents
   - Handles exceptions and escalations
   - Tracks progress and provides status updates

2. **Use Case Agent**:
   - Interprets business requirements
   - Generates structured requirement specifications
   - Validates understanding with business stakeholders

3. **Data Designer Agent**:
   - Analyzes requirements from Use Case Agent
   - Recommends optimal data product structure
   - Generates schema definitions and entity relationship diagrams

4. **Source System Agent**:
   - Identifies relevant data sources based on requirements
   - Catalogs available attributes from source systems
   - Assesses data quality and suitability

5. **Mapping Agent**:
   - Creates detailed source-to-target mappings
   - Defines transformation logic
   - Generates ETL/ELT implementation code

6. **Certification Agent**:
   - Validates the data product against governance standards
   - Ensures compliance and quality requirements are met
   - Produces certification documentation

### Workflow Sequence
1. Business stakeholders initiate the process with requirements
2. Use Case Agent processes and structures requirements
